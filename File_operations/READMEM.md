#  File Management Subsystem in Linux System Programming

This document provides a detailed overview of the File Management Subsystem in Linux. It explains how Linux handles files at the system level using kernel structures, file descriptors, and system calls. It also compares low-level I/O system calls with high-level standard I/O functions in C.

## 1. What is File Management in Linux?

File Management in Linux refers to how the OS allows processes to create, read, write, and manage files using **system calls**. These operations are performed via interfaces exposed by the kernel.

## 2. Linux File Types

| File Type         | Description                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Regular File      | Text or binary data                          |
| Directory         | Container for other files/directories        |
| Symbolic Link     | Reference to another file                    |
| Character Device  | Handles character-by-character data (e.g., `/dev/tty`) |
| Block Device      | Handles data in blocks (e.g., `/dev/sda`)    |
| Socket            | Used for inter-process communication         |
| FIFO (Named Pipe) | One-way inter-process data stream            |

---

## 3. File Descriptors and the Kernel

Every process has a file descriptor table. Descriptors point to file objects in the kernel.

| FD Number | Meaning         |
|-----------|------------------|
| `0`       | Standard Input   |
| `1`       | Standard Output  |
| `2`       | Standard Error   |

The file descriptor links to a file object, which references the inode structure containing file metadata.

---

## 4. Important System Calls

| System Call | Purpose                      |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| `open()`    | Opens or creates a file      |
| `read()`    | Reads data from a file       |
| `write()`   | Writes data to a file        |
| `lseek()`   | Moves the file pointer       |
| `close()`   | Closes the file              |
| `stat()`    | Gets file metadata           |
| `unlink()`  | Deletes a file               |
| `chmod()`   | Changes file permissions     |
| `mkdir()`   | Creates a directory          |
| `readdir()` | Reads directory contents     |

---

## 5. File Object vs Inode Object

| Concept     | File Object                         | Inode Object                        |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Purpose     | Manages file access and position    | Stores metadata and file structure |
| Location    | Kernel memory                       | Filesystem on disk                 |
| Unique Per  | Open file instance                  | Each file (not each open)          |
| Contains    | File offset, flags, access mode     | Size, UID, GID, timestamps, links  |

---

## 6. File Operations in User Space

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char buf[100];
    read(fd, buf, 100);
    write(1, buf, 100); // output to stdout
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
````

This demonstrates basic system calls: open → read → write → close.

## 7. Basic I/O vs C Standard Library I/O

Linux provides both **low-level (system calls)** and **high-level (C stdio)** file handling methods.

###  Comparison Table

| Feature         | Basic I/O System Calls (`<unistd.h>`)    | C Standard Library I/O (`<stdio.h>`)         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Functions**   | `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()` | `fopen()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`, `fclose()` |
| **Level**       | Low-level, kernel interface              | High-level, portable abstraction             |
| **Buffering**   | No buffering (raw read/write)            | Buffered internally                          |
| **Return Type** | File Descriptor (`int`)                  | `FILE*` pointer                              |
| **Portability** | Platform-specific (Unix/Linux)           | Portable across platforms                    |
| **Performance** | Fast for small, controlled operations    | Buffered, better for large sequential I/O    |
| **Use Case**    | Embedded, system tools, device drivers   | General applications, user programs          |

###  Code Comparison

####  Low-Level I/O (System Calls)

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char buf[100];
    read(fd, buf, 100);
    write(1, buf, 100);  // write to stdout
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

####  High-Level I/O (C Standard Library)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
    char buf[100];
    fread(buf, sizeof(char), 100, fp);
    fwrite(buf, sizeof(char), 100, stdout);
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```
